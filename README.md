# Project Title: Understanding Restaurant Success: A Data-Driven Approach

## Overview
Restaurants are a vibrant part of our economy and culture. However, they face a high failure rate, often due to a lack of market knowledge and planning. My project aims to tackle this issue by using data science to identify the key factors that contribute to a restaurant's success.

## Problem Statement
The problem is that many restaurants fail because they lack a deep understanding of what makes a restaurant successful in a given market.

## Proposed Solution
I propose to develop a data science model that classifies the success of restaurants based on various factors, with the review score and review count serving as indicators of success. This model can help prospective restaurant owners understand their market better and plan their strategy more effectively.

## Impact
By providing insights into the key success factors, this model can help restaurant owners make informed strategic decisions, potentially reducing the restaurant failure rate. It can also help invigorate and diversify the restaurant industry by enabling new entrants to compete more effectively.

## Dataset
I am using Yelp's business data for my analysis. This dataset includes various attributes 
'business_id', 'name', 'address', 'city', 'state', 'postal_code','latitude', 'longitude', 'stars','review_count', 'is_open','attributes', 'categories', 'hours'.

I am focusing specifically on restaurants, rate, review counts, categories for my study.

In my initial exploration and cleaning of the data, I filtered out irrelevant categories and consolidated similar ones. My preliminary exploratory data analysis indicated that certain types of restaurants are more common, suggesting that market saturation could be an important factor in a restaurant's success.

Next Steps

Further data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing or anomalous values.
More in-depth exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships.
Developing a baseline model using suitable machine learning algorithms.
Evaluating and refining the model for better accuracy and reliability.

# Predictive Reataturant Rating Project
NOTE: I have 3Notebooks of EDA , 1 is all the features including cities, the other one all features without the cities , and the last one only checking correlation between cities and targetvar. 

**May be check the one with cities first !!**

This repository hosts a predictive analytics project, aiming to harness the power of machine learning to understand and predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The project integrates various steps of the data science pipeline, including an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the application of machine learning models.

## Introduction

Provide a brief overview of the project's goal, the dataset in use, and its significance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is a foundational step in our project, aiming to visually and statistically uncover the primary characteristics and patterns within the dataset.

### Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing values.
- Detected and rectified outliers using visual tools such as box plots.

### Feature Engineering
- Derived new features to strengthen the modeling process.
- Selected pertinent features based on their correlation with the target variable.

### Visualizations
- Used histograms for understanding individual variable distributions.
- Employed scatter plots to discern relationships and potential patterns.
- Leveraged box plots for understanding spread and detecting outliers.
- Incorporated heatmaps to visualize correlations between variables.

### Statistical Analysis
- Conducted hypothesis testing to validate observations.
- Applied ANOVA for discerning differences across various groups.

### Data Transformation
- Normalized and standardized features.
- Efficiently encoded categorical variables.

### Insights and Observations
- Drew data-driven insights crucial for business decisions.

## Modeling

### Logistic Regression
Currently, the Logistic Regression model serves as the project's foundation. It is being tuned and validated for the best performance.

### Decision Trees
The Decision Tree model is under experimentation to understand and predict the outcomes.

## Future Work

We are planning to expand our model arsenal by experimenting with Random Forests, applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, employing cross-validation for better model validation, and integrating pipelines and hyperparameter optimization.
